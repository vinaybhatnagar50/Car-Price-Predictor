# Car Price Predictor

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

While pricing new cars is relatively straightforward for companies, determining the appropriate price for used cars is a challenging task due to various influencing factors such as brand, manufacturing year, and more. The goal of this project is to predict the best price for pre-owned cars in the Indian market using Linear Regression, leveraging historical data on sold cars.

### Objective

The primary objective is to develop an efficient Linear Regression model that accurately predicts the price of used cars. The model will consider factors such as car brand, model, manufacturing year, fuel type, and mileage.

### Purpose

The used car market is booming, and the project aims to provide a machine learning solution for predicting car prices, eliminating human intervention. The prediction model will be a valuable tool for both buyers and sellers, enhancing the understanding of market trends and enabling better-informed decisions.



## Model Selection
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm based on data complexity and performance requirements.

### Linear Regression

### Decision Trees


### Random Forest

### Gradient Boosting

### XGBoost


## Model Training and Evaluation

- Train the selected model on the training data.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared.
- Refine and retrain the model as needed until satisfactory performance is achieved.

## Model Evolution

Car price prediction models are dynamic and need regular updates to stay relevant.

- Retrain the model with new data.
- Add new features or incorporate user feedback.
- Continuously evaluate and refine the model to ensure accuracy and usefulness.

## Conclusion

Building a car price prediction model involves careful consideration of each step, from data collection to model evolution. The project aims to provide a valuable tool for the used car market, enhancing decision-making for both buyers and sellers. As machine learning evolves, these models will continue to improve, offering even more accurate predictions and valuable insights.
