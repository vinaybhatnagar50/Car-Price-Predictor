# Car-Price-Predictor

Problem Statement: 

It is easy for any company to price their new cars based on the manufacturing and marketing cost it involves. But when it comes to a used car it is quite difficult to define a price because it involves it is influenced by various parameters like car brand, manufactured year and etc. The goal of our project is to predict the best price for a pre-owned car in the Indian market based on the previous data related to sold cars using Linear Regression.

Objective of The Project:

The objective of this project is to create an efficient and effective model that will be able to predict the price of a used car by using the Linear Regression algorithm with better accuracy. 
•	Brand or Type of the car one prefers like Ford, Hyundai 
•	Model of the car namely Ford Figo, Hyundai Creta 
•	Year of manufacturing like 2020, 2021 
•	Type of fuel namely Petrol, Diesel 
•	Number of kilometers car has travelled  

Purose of Project :

The used car market is an ever-rising industry, which has almost doubled its market value in the last few years. The emergence of online portals such as CarDheko, Quikr, Carwale, Cars24, and many others has facilitated the need for both the customer and the seller to be better informed about the trends and patterns that determine the value of the used car in the market. Machine Learning algorithms can be used to predict the retail value of a car, based on a certain set of features. The purpose of this project is to provide Car price prediction using machine learning without any human interference. 
 In our day to day lives everyone buys and sells a car every day. Now there are limited facilities and applications to get an appropriate price for one’s car. Now use this application to get an estimate value of the car. 

Project Goal :

Required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. Can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market. 

1.	DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING
   
Data collection and processing are crucial steps in building a car price prediction machine learning model. In this process, need to collect a large and diverse dataset, clean and preprocess the data, and finally split it into training and testing sets. Here are some steps involved in data collection and processing:

•	Data Collection: Can collect car price data from various sources such as online marketplaces, dealerships, and car listings. Can also collect data from public datasets available on the internet, such as Kaggle. It is important to collect a diverse dataset that covers a wide range of car models, makes, and years. The dataset should also include various features such as year, mileage, make, model, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and owner.

•	Data Preprocessing: In this step, need to preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning models. This involves scaling and normalizing the data, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering. Feature engineering involves creating new features that might be useful in predicting car prices. For example, can create a new feature by combining the year and mileage of the car to represent its age.
In summary, data collection and processing are crucial steps in building a car price prediction machine learning model. A diverse and preprocessing, are all essential for building an accurate and reliable model.

2.  DATA PREPARATION

Data preparation involves preparing the data for analysis. This includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, ensuring that the data is balanced, and scaling or normalizing the data to ensure that all features are on the same scale. This step is crucial to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data and can generalize well to new data. Here are some steps involved in data preparation:

•	Data Cleaning: The first step in data preparation is to clean the data by removing duplicates, missing values, and outliers. This is important to ensure that the data is consistent and accurate. May need to use various techniques such as imputation, interpolation, or deletion to handle missing data. Outliers can be removed using statistical techniques such as Z-score, IQR, or visual inspection.

•	Data Integration: The next step is to integrate the different datasets collected from various sources into a single dataset. This involves combining the data based on common attributes such as car model, make, and year. It is important to ensure that the data is consistent across all datasets and that there are no discrepancies.

•	Data Transformation: In this step, need to transform the data into a format suitable for machine learning models. This involves scaling and normalizing the data, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering. Scaling and normalization are important to ensure that the features are on the same scale and have similar distributions. Categorical variables can be encoded using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding. Feature engineering involves creating new features that might be useful in predicting car prices. For example, can create a new feature by combining the year and mileage of the car to represent its age.

•	Feature Selection: Once the data is transformed, need to select the most important features for training the machine learning model. This is important to avoid overfitting and to improve the generalization performance of the model. Can use various feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, or principal component analysis.

•	Data Splitting: Finally, need to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the model. It is important to ensure that the data is split randomly and that the distribution of car prices is similar in both sets.

3.	MODEL SELECTION

There are several machine learning algorithms that can be used for car price prediction, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests. The choice of algorithm depends on the complexity of the data and the performance requirements of the model. Linear regression is a simple and interpretable algorithm that can be used for simple datasets, while decision trees and random forests are more complex algorithms that can handle more complex datasets. Here are some commonly used models for car price prediction:

•	Linear Regression: Linear regression is a simple and interpretable model that can be used to predict a continuous variable, such as the price of a car. It works by fitting a line to the data that minimizes the sum of squared errors. Linear regression can be a good choice if the dataset is relatively small and the relationship between the features and the target variable is linear.

•	Decision Trees: Decision trees are a type of model that can handle both categorical and continuous features. They work by recursively splitting the data based on the features that provide the most information gain, creating a tree-like structure that can be used for prediction. Decision trees can be a good choice if the dataset is large and complex, and the relationship between the features and the target variable is non-linear.

•	Random Forest: Random forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Random forest works by building a large number of decision trees on randomly sampled subsets of the data, and then aggregating the predictions of the individual trees. Random forest can be a good choice if the dataset is large and complex, and the relationship between the features and the target variable is non-linear.

•	Gradient Boosting: Gradient boosting is another ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a stronger model. Gradient boosting works by sequentially adding decision trees that correct the errors of the previous trees, gradually improving the accuracy of the model. Gradient boosting can be a good choice if the dataset is large and complex, and the relationship between the features and the target variable is non-linear.

•	Xgboost: XGBoost is a popular machine learning algorithm that is often used in regression and classification tasks. It is an extension of the gradient boosting algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a more accurate and robust model.
XGBoost uses a gradient descent optimization algorithm to minimize a loss function that measures the difference between the predicted and actual output values. The algorithm works by adding new decision trees to the model in a sequential manner, with each tree attempting to correct the errors made by the previous trees. This process continues until the error cannot be further reduced or a pre-defined stopping criteria is met.
One advantage of XGBoost is its ability to handle missing data and incorporate different types of features, including categorical variables. It also includes regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance.
In the context of car price prediction, XGBoost can be used to train a model on a dataset containing information about car features such as the year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and owner history. The trained model can then be used to predict the price of a car given its features.
The choice of model will depends in the specifics of the dataset and the desired accuracy of the model. It’s important to try multiple models and evaluate their performance using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared, before selecting the final model.

4.	MODEL TRAINING AND EVALUATION

Once the model is selected, it needs to be trained and evaluated. This involves training the model on the training data and evaluating its performance on the testing data. Common metrics used for evaluation include mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared. The model can then be refined and retrained until it achieves satisfactory performance.

5.	MODEL EVOLUTION

Car price prediction models are not static and need to be updated regularly to reflect changes in the market and the availability of new data. This process may involve retraining the model with new data, adding new features, or incorporating feedback from users. Continuous evaluation and refinement of the model are necessary to ensure that it remains accurate and useful.

Building a car price prediction model involves several key steps, including data collection and processing, data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, model training and evaluation, and model evolution. Each step is important and requires careful consideration to ensure that the model is accurate and useful. As machine learning continues to evolve, new techniques and approaches will emerge, and car price prediction models will become even more accurate and useful.
